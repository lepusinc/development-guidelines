# Issues

In software development projects, issues are classified into several types.
Using templates for each type promotes smooth communication and development.

## Epic

An Epic is a large-scale feature development or improvement that encompasses multiple stories.
It is used to manage long-term goals that may not be completed in a single sprint or release.

## Story

A Story describes a valuable feature or requirement from the user's perspective.
It is small enough for a development team to complete in one sprint and has specific acceptance criteria (conditions for completion).

## Task

A Task is a specific work item broken down from a story from a technical point of view.
It describes the actual work that developers do, such as "implement an API" or "change the database schema."

## Bug

A Bug is an issue for reporting software defects or unexpected behavior.
It clearly describes the steps to reproduce, the expected result, and the actual result, and requests investigation and correction.

## Sub-task

A Sub-task is a work item further subdivided from a story or task.
It is used for more detailed progress management and to facilitate division of labor among multiple people.
